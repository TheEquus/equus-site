&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll be introducing a roughly two week project that I worked on with two other group mates for a uni subject. The theme we were given was to build something that makes our home smarter or more fun. As a team, we started off with the idea of a password manager and decided to add some small fun elements, that would make this password manager the most fun password manager out there (hopefully).
This page will talk about the technical side of the password manager system itself in more detail than the video, as well as a bit about editing (with a tiny bit of animating) a video.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
