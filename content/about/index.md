Hello! I am Annie Nie, I'm a Bachelor's student studying Computing and Software Systems (basically computer science) at the University of Melbourne.  
I'm interested in exploring hardware in cyber security, and currently play CTFs with [skateboarding dog](https://ctftime.org/team/140575)🛹🐶. Previously, I had played with [misc](https://ctftime.org/team/109523).
