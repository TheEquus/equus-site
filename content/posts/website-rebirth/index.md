## The Beginning
It's mid October, exam preparation season. My biggest concern? Whether I should make some big changes to my website. But first the most important consideration, an interesting name for this project. Here were some very random names that came to mind (notice a trend?):  
- Catullus XVI
- Secundus Equus (second horse)
- hodie iter incipiamus (let's begin the journey at once - my plea to stop myself from procrastinating)

Ultimate goal: keep many of the functionalities, but have more of an understanding of how I can change things if need be
functions to keep:
- Colour changing (color your world template)
- darkmode and light mode
- search bar for posts
